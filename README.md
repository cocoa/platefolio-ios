#  Platefolio (iOS)

Platefolio is a personal iOS app created for collecting, decoding, organising and gameifying custom U.K. car number plates.

Custom numer plates are amazing in so many ways, often through their wordplay, personal references, subtle flexes or just being unintentionnally funny. Platefolio exists as a way to capture those moments where a custom plate is spotted, organises them meaningfully, and decodes what the plate is trying to convey to the viewer.

This project is also a practical way for me to learn:
- Backend development
- Data modelling
- UI iteration
- Real Git workflows
